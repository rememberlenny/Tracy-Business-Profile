Introduction
====================
NARGA Framework is an extremely versatile HTML5 & CSS3 WordPress framework based on ZURB's [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), a powerful tool for building prototypes on any kind of devices. It'll help you do amazing things faster & easier than ever before. Along with the elegant design the theme is easily customizable with numerous theme options through Theme Customization. This Framework follows [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) standard with the layout grid inspired by ZURB Foundation Templates and is [hNews microformat](https://www.readability.com/publishers/guidelines) ready. It is optimized for Search Engine while at the same time improves readability.

Because it's a percentage based grid system, it means that it will perfectly adapt to all screen resolutions (mobile, tablets and big screens). It is extremely easy to create your blog, CMS, brochure and any other kind of sites with NARGA Framework.

I've tested and found that NARGA Framework works well with [bbPress 2.0](http://bbpress.org/) and [BuddyPress 1.5](http://buddypress.org/) but this time it's not official compatible with them.

Shortcodes
=========
I've converted almost main ZURB Foundation functions to shortcodes. That’s why the decision is up to you – you either install our shortcode plugins designed to work with themes using Foundation CSS & JS or you don’t. It’s that easy!

***Alert Box Shortcode***

The [alert]…[/alert] shortcode gives you and your editors and easy way to display the [Foundation Alerts][http://foundation.zurb.com/old-docs/f3/elements.php#alertsEx] with some additional options.

_Shortcode options_

[alert]…[/alert] // no options

[alert type=alert]…[/alert] // type attribute alert

[alert type=success]…[/alert] // type attribute success

[alert type=secondary]…[/alert] // type attribute secondary

[alert close=no]…[/alert] // no close button

[alert timeout=10000]…[/alert] // timeout of 10s

***Columns Shortcodes***

One of the best features of Foundation is the powerful grid it offers, used throughout required+ Foundation. We took the grid and turned it into an easy and powerful shortcode plugin, meet [column]:

// The first example
[column columns=4]…[/column][column columns=8]…[/column]

// The second example
[column columns=3]…[/column][column columns=6]…[/column][column columns=3]…[/column]

// The third example (note the offset attribute)
[column columns=6 offset=3]…[/column][column columns=3]…[/column]


***Button Shortcode***

Easy to add a button with pre-define shortcodes

[button]…[/button] // no options

[button style=secondary/alert/success]…[/button] // style of buttons

[button type=radius/round]…[/button] // type of buttons
